This is the remind file, it gets parsed everytime `remind` is ran.

What is the benefit of running `remind.js` instead of just reading this file? I
don't know.

Actually, being serious, is just the date information. This file contains all
your important dates, and `remind.js` queries this file for upcoming dates and
prints those.

`remind.js` is currently lacking "cool" features but it does what I need for
now. The idea is to just print upcoming dates for the next 7 days.

The date formats are:

- day/month/year: to repeat a single time
- day/month: to repeat annually
- day: to repeat monthly
- weekday: like "tue" or "friday", to repeat all weeks at that day

This file ignores all these comments, it begins parsing after the "separator"


separator:#

thu      # this event runs on thursdays
friday   # this event runs on fridays
sun      # it's sunday
12 25    # crismas
2025 1 1 # a new year, so full opportunities and all that
tue,thu  # swimming classes or something
